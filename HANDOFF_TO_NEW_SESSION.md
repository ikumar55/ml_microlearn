# HANDOFF TO NEW SESSION
**Date**: January 14, 2025  
**Purpose**: Critical situation requiring immediate attention

---

## 🚨 CURRENT CRITICAL PROBLEM

**THE ISSUE**: iOS simulator build keeps failing due to persistent conda contamination
- Every `flutter run` command fails with conda clang errors
- `/Users/yessir/miniforge3/lib/clang/18/include/tgmath.h:12:9` appears in build errors
- Terminal sessions get stuck/unresponsive during build attempts
- Conda auto-activates itself (prompt shows `(base)`) despite deactivation attempts

## ✅ WHAT'S WORKING

**App Code Status**:
- ✅ All major features (Phases 1.1-2.4) are implemented and functional
- ✅ Lecture creation bug was FIXED (Create button now enables when typing)
- ✅ Environment cleanup process identified and documented
- ✅ CocoaPods and dependencies are properly installed

**Proven Working Solution**:
1. `flutter clean && flutter pub get`
2. `flutter build ios --debug --no-codesign` 
3. `flutter run -d "iPhone 16 Plus"`
BUT: Step 3 fails due to conda contamination recurring

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE GOALS

1. **PRIORITY 1**: Permanently solve conda contamination (disable auto-activation)
2. **PRIORITY 2**: Get clean iOS simulator build working
3. **PRIORITY 3**: Test lecture creation dialog works (both Create and Cancel buttons)
4. **PRIORITY 4**: Continue with remaining features (class deletion, flashcard editing, etc.)

## 📁 KEY FILES TO READ

**CRITICAL (read these first)**:
1. `CRITICAL_FIXES.md` - Complete solution documentation
2. `FEATURE_VALIDATION_LOG.md` - Current testing status
3. `FLUTTER_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md` - How development workflow should work

**Implementation Status**:
4. `lib/screens/lectures_screen.dart` - Lecture creation fix was applied here
5. `lib/services/database_helper.dart` - Web database fixes applied

## 🛠️ ENVIRONMENT STATE

**Current State**:
- iPhone 16 Plus simulator is available and working
- CocoaPods installed via Homebrew at `/opt/homebrew/bin/pod`
- All Flutter dependencies are installed
- Project is clean (recent `flutter clean` completed)

**Problem State**:
- Conda keeps reactivating itself
- PATH gets contaminated with `/Users/yessir/miniforge3/...` paths
- iOS builds fail with DarwinFoundation module errors

## 📋 TODO LIST STATUS

**Completed**:
- ✅ Environment diagnosis
- ✅ CocoaPods installation  
- ✅ iOS clean builds (when environment clean)
- ✅ Lecture creation bug fix
- ✅ Feature validation (partial)

**Pending**:
- ❌ Permanent conda contamination solution
- ❌ Stable iOS simulator workflow
- ❌ Class deletion functionality
- ❌ Flashcard editing capability
- ❌ Study tab redesign

## 🎯 NEXT ACTIONS

1. **Solve conda auto-activation permanently**
2. **Test clean iOS build and launch**
3. **Verify lecture creation dialog works properly**
4. **Continue with pending feature implementations**

**Note**: User has working app code but cannot test it due to build environment issues. Focus on environment stability first, then feature development.

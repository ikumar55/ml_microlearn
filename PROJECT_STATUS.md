# ML MicroLearn - Current Project Status & Critical Issues

**Last Updated**: January 14, 2025, 3:45 AM  
**Current Phase**: Phase 2.1+ Class Management Interface (BLOCKED)  
**App Status**: ❌ CRITICAL ISSUES - App not reflecting code changes, shows 'coming soon' instead of implemented features

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES (BLOCKING DEVELOPMENT)

### ❌ PRIMARY PROBLEM: Simulator Not Reflecting Code Changes
- **Symptom**: Class management shows "coming soon" instead of implemented functionality
- **Impact**: Cannot test or validate any implemented features
- **Code Status**: All features are implemented in code but not visible in simulator
- **User Experience**: Clicking "+" for classes shows placeholder text instead of add class dialog

### ❌ SECONDARY PROBLEMS
- **CocoaPods Installation Failed**: Ruby version 2.6.10 too old (needs 2.7.0+)
- **iOS Build Environment**: Conda environment interference with Xcode builds
- **Hot Reload Not Available**: Cannot use `r`/`R` commands because app won't start properly

### ✅ What's Actually Implemented (But Not Visible)
- **Class Management**: Add/edit/delete classes with color picker
- **Lecture Navigation**: Drill-down from classes to lectures to flashcards  
- **Flashcard Management**: Full CRUD with active/inactive toggle
- **Batch Operations**: Multi-select flashcard operations
- **Study Interface**: Complete flashcard quiz with spaced repetition
- **Database Layer**: Fully functional with sample ML data
- **Navigation**: Bottom navigation with 4 tabs

### ❌ What We Can't Verify Due to Simulator Issues
- Whether implemented features actually work
- User interface functionality 
- Database integration
- Hot reload workflow (`r`/`R` commands)

- **Study Screen**: Full-screen flashcard display with flip animation
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicator with session stats
- **Answer Buttons**: "Got It!" and "Need Practice" with immediate feedback

#### Phase 2.4: Spaced Repetition ✅ (Complete but unverified)
- **SM-2 Algorithm**: Implemented and integrated with study interface
- **Performance Tracking**: Response time and accuracy recording
- **Review Scheduling**: Cards due based on difficulty and performance

## 🔧 TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Database Schema (SQLite)
```sql
study_classes: id, name, color, created_at, total_flashcards, active_flashcards
lectures: id, class_id, title, notes, created_at, flashcard_count
flashcards: id, lecture_id, question, answer, is_active, difficulty, 
           correct_count, incorrect_count, last_reviewed, next_review, 
           consecutive_correct, created_at
study_sessions: id, flashcard_id, was_correct, session_date, response_time_ms, source
```

### Key Files Created
- `lib/models/` - All data models with full functionality
- `lib/services/database_helper.dart` - SQLite operations
- `lib/services/study_repository.dart` - Business logic layer
- `lib/services/index.dart` - Barrel file for clean imports

### Recent Issues Resolved
- **UNIQUE constraint failed**: Old test data conflicts
- **Missing `source` column**: Database schema inconsistencies
- **Blank screen**: Async database tests blocking UI

## 🚨 CRITICAL NEXT STEPS (URGENT)

### Priority 1: Fix Simulator/Build Environment (BLOCKING ALL DEVELOPMENT)
1. **Resolve CocoaPods Issues**: 
   - Install Ruby 2.7+ or use alternative method
   - Complete iOS dependency setup
   - Get `pod install` working properly
2. **Clean Build Environment**:
   - Complete conda environment deactivation
   - Ensure system clang is used instead of conda clang
   - Verify Xcode build chain is clean
3. **Verify Code Reflection**: 
   - Ensure simulator shows implemented features
   - Test that "coming soon" is replaced with actual functionality
   - Confirm hot reload (`r`/`R`) commands work

### Priority 2: Environment Recovery Strategy
1. **Document Current State**: Capture all terminal errors and build logs
2. **Try Alternative Approaches**:
   - Web version (`flutter run -d chrome`) as fallback
   - Android emulator if available
   - Consider fresh Flutter installation
3. **Verify Implementation**: Once simulator works, test all implemented features

### Priority 3: Post-Recovery Validation
1. **Test All Implemented Features**: Classes, lectures, flashcards, study interface
2. **Verify Database Integration**: Ensure CRUD operations work end-to-end
3. **Document Working Workflow**: Hot reload, testing, and development cycle

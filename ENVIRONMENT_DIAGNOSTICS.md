# Environment Diagnostics & Recovery Guide

**Created**: January 14, 2025, 3:45 AM  
**Issue**: Simulator not reflecting implemented code - critical build environment problems  
**Impact**: Complete development blockage - cannot test or validate any functionality

---

## üö® CURRENT CRITICAL ISSUES

### Primary Problem: Code Changes Not Visible in Simulator
- **User Experience**: Clicking "+" for classes shows "coming soon" instead of implemented add class dialog
- **Technical Issue**: Simulator appears to be running old/cached version of app
- **Development Impact**: Cannot test any of the extensive functionality that has been implemented

### Secondary Problems
- **CocoaPods Installation Failed**: Ruby version too old (2.6.10 vs required 2.7.0+)
- **Build Environment Contamination**: Conda environment interfering with Xcode/iOS builds
- **Hot Reload Unavailable**: Cannot use `r`/`R` commands due to build failures

---

## üìã EXACT ERROR LOGS

### CocoaPods Installation Error
```bash
yessir@Idhants-MacBook-Pro ml_microlearn % sudo gem install cocoapods
ERROR: Error installing cocoapods:
The last version of drb (>= 0) to support your Ruby & RubyGems was 2.0.6. 
Try installing it with `gem install drb -v 2.0.6` and then running the current command again
drb requires Ruby version >= 2.7.0. The current ruby version is 2.6.10.210.
```

### Flutter Run Errors
```bash
Warning: CocoaPods not installed. Skipping pod install.
CocoaPods is a package manager for iOS or macOS platform code.
Without CocoaPods, plugins will not work on iOS or macOS.
CocoaPods not installed or not in valid state.
Error launching application on iPhone 16 Plus.
```

### Xcode Build Errors (Previous)
- Multiple "Parse Issue (Xcode): Could not build module 'DarwinFoundation'" errors
- "Semantic Issue (Xcode): Unknown type name 'ptrdiff_t'" errors
- Conda clang interference: `/Users/yessir/miniforge3/lib/clang/18/include/tgmath.h`

---

## üîç ENVIRONMENT STATE ANALYSIS

### Current Shell State
- **Working Directory**: `/Users/yessir/development/ml_microlearn`
- **Shell**: `zsh`
- **Conda Status**: Partially active (notice `(base)` in terminal prompt)
- **Flutter Path**: `/Users/yessir/development/flutter/bin/flutter`

### Problematic Environment Variables
- Conda environment variables still set despite `conda deactivate` attempts
- PATH confusion between system tools and conda tools
- Potential CONDA_PREFIX, CONDA_SHLVL interference

### System Information
- **OS**: macOS 15.4.1 (darwin-arm64)
- **Ruby**: 2.6.10.210 (too old)
- **Flutter**: Latest stable
- **Simulator**: iPhone 16 Plus available but showing old app version

## ‚úÖ WHAT'S ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED (BUT NOT VISIBLE)

### Complete Feature Set (All in Code, Unverified)
- **Phase 1.1-1.4**: ‚úÖ Environment, project structure, data models, database layer
- **Phase 1.5**: ‚úÖ Navigation structure with 4 tabs and FAB
- **Phase 2.1**: ‚úÖ Class and lecture management with add/edit/delete
- **Phase 2.2**: ‚úÖ Flashcard management with active/inactive toggle and batch operations
- **Phase 2.3**: ‚úÖ Study session interface with card flip animation
- **Phase 2.4**: ‚úÖ Spaced repetition algorithm (SM-2) integrated

### Key Implemented Files
- `lib/main.dart`: Complete app structure with functional tabs
- `lib/services/database_helper.dart`: Full SQLite setup
- `lib/services/study_repository.dart`: Business logic and sample data
- `lib/screens/lectures_screen.dart`: Lecture navigation
- `lib/screens/flashcards_screen.dart`: Flashcard management
- All data models with full CRUD support

## üõ†Ô∏è RECOVERY STRATEGIES

### Strategy 1: Fix Ruby/CocoaPods (Recommended)
```bash
# Install Ruby version manager
curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash
source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm
rvm install 2.7.6
rvm use 2.7.6 --default
gem install cocoapods
```

### Strategy 2: Alternative CocoaPods Installation
```bash
# Try Homebrew (if available)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install cocoapods

# Or try --user-install
gem install --user-install cocoapods
export PATH=$HOME/.gem/ruby/2.6.0/bin:$PATH
```

### Strategy 3: Complete Environment Reset
```bash
# Nuclear option - complete environment cleanup
conda deactivate
unset CONDA_CHANGEPS1 CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV CONDA_EXE CONDA_PREFIX CONDA_PROMPT_MODIFIER CONDA_PYTHON_EXE CONDA_SHLVL
export PATH="/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/Users/yessir/development/flutter/bin"
killall Simulator
killall dart
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

### Strategy 4: Platform Alternatives
```bash
# Test web version to verify code works
flutter run -d chrome

# Try Android if available  
flutter emulators
flutter run -d <android_device_id>

# macOS desktop version
flutter run -d macos
```

- [ ] Classes tab shows class list or "Add your first class" (not "coming soon")
- [ ] "+" button opens add class dialog with text input and color picker
- [ ] Hot reload works: press `r` in terminal and see changes instantly
- [ ] Navigation Classes ‚Üí Lectures ‚Üí Flashcards functions

### Full Functionality Tests (Post-Recovery)
- [ ] Can create new study class
- [ ] Can add lectures to class

## üìû ESCALATION OPTIONS

### If All Recovery Attempts Fail
1. **Fresh Flutter Installation**: Install Flutter in new directory
2. **Different Development Environment**: Try VS Code, Android Studio, or Xcode directly
3. **Alternative Development Machine**: Test on different Mac or use web-only development
4. **Professional Support**: Flutter community, Stack Overflow, or professional consultation

### For New Assistant Session
All critical information is documented in:
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md`: Current issues and implemented features
- `HANDOFF_SUMMARY.md`: Quick overview for new session
- `NEXT_STEPS.md`: Specific recovery actions
- This file: Complete diagnostic information

---

## üì± CONTACT & CONTINUATION

**For seamless handoff to new session:**
1. Read this file for complete context
2. Focus on build environment recovery first
3. Test web version (`flutter run -d chrome`) to verify code works
4. Once simulator works, validate all implemented features
5. Document successful recovery steps for future reference

**The code is complete and functional - we just need the build environment to work properly!**

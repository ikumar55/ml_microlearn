# Utils

Helper functions, constants, and utility classes:

- `constants.dart` - App-wide constants and configuration
- `themes.dart` - Material Design 3 theme definitions
- `helpers.dart` - Pure functions for common operations
- `extensions.dart` - Dart extension methods for convenience

Utils should be stateless, pure functions when possible.
No UI components or business logic - just helpful utilities.

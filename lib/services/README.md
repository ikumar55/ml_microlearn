# Services

Business logic and external system integrations:

- `database_helper.dart` - SQLite database operations and migrations
- `notification_service.dart` - Local push notifications management
- `spaced_repetition.dart` - Algorithm for optimal review scheduling
- `background_processor.dart` - Background tasks and scheduling
- `recommendation_engine.dart` - Study suggestions and insights

Services are singleton classes that handle complex operations and maintain no UI state.

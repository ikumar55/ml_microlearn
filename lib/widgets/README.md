# Widgets

Reusable UI components used across multiple screens:

- `flashcard_widget.dart` - Animated card flip component
- `progress_chart.dart` - Charts for analytics visualization
- `class_card.dart` - Class display component with color coding
- `common/` - Shared components like buttons, inputs, dialogs

Widgets are stateless when possible and accept data via constructor parameters.
Focus on reusability and consistent styling.

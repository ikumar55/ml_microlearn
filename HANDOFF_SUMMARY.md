# Project Handoff Summary - ML MicroLearn

**Status**: ‚ùå CRITICAL ISSUES - App not reflecting code changes, simulator showing old placeholder content  
**Next Priority**: Fix build environment and simulator issues (BLOCKING ALL DEVELOPMENT)  
**Estimated Time to Recovery**: 60-90 minutes of environment troubleshooting

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES (BLOCKING ALL DEVELOPMENT)

### ‚ùå PRIMARY PROBLEM: Code Changes Not Reflected in Simulator
- **Symptom**: Clicking "+" for classes shows "coming soon" placeholder instead of implemented add class dialog
- **Impact**: Cannot test any of the extensive functionality that's been implemented
- **Build Environment**: CocoaPods installation failed (Ruby 2.6.10 too old, needs 2.7+)
- **Hot Reload**: Cannot use `r`/`R` commands because app won't start properly due to build issues

### ‚úÖ What's Actually Implemented in Code (But Not Visible)
- **Complete data models** with spaced repetition support (Phases 1.1-1.4 ‚úÖ)
- **Database schema** with full CRUD operations (Phase 1.4 ‚úÖ)
- **Navigation structure** with 4 tabs and FAB (Phase 1.5 ‚úÖ)
- **Class management** with add/edit/delete and color picker (Phase 2.1 ‚úÖ)
- **Lecture management** with hierarchical navigation (Phase 2.1 ‚úÖ)
- **Flashcard management** with active/inactive toggle and batch operations (Phase 2.2 ‚úÖ)
- **Study interface** with card flip animation and spaced repetition (Phase 2.3-2.4 ‚úÖ)

### ‚ùå What We Can't Verify Due to Simulator Issues
- Whether implemented features actually work as intended
- Database integration and CRUD operations
- User interface functionality and navigation flow
- Hot reload development workflow

## üìÅ KEY FILES REFERENCE

### Essential Documents
- **PROJECT_STATUS.md** - Complete current status
- **NEXT_STEPS.md** - Immediate action items  
- **DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md** - Full project roadmap
- **README.md** - (You may want to create this)

### Core Implementation
- **lib/main.dart** - App entry point (clean)
- **lib/models/\*** - Complete data models
- **lib/services/\*** - Database and business logic
- **lib/screens/\*** - Placeholder tabs (needs implementation)

---

## üö® IMMEDIATE CRITICAL ACTIONS

### 1. Fix Build Environment (Priority 1 - BLOCKING)
**Goal**: Get simulator to show implemented code instead of "coming soon" placeholders

**Specific Issues to Resolve**:
- **CocoaPods Installation**: Ruby 2.6.10 ‚Üí 2.7+ or alternative method
- **Conda Environment**: Complete deactivation to avoid clang conflicts
- **Xcode Build Chain**: Ensure system tools are used, not conda tools
- **iOS Dependencies**: Get `pod install` working properly

### 2. Verify Code Reflection (Priority 2)
**Goal**: Confirm all implemented features are visible in simulator

**Test Points**:
- Classes tab shows class list (not "coming soon")
- "+" button opens add class dialog (not placeholder)
- Navigation to lectures and flashcards works
- Study interface shows real flashcards
- Hot reload (`r`/`R`) commands work properly

### 3. Post-Recovery Validation (Priority 3)
**Goal**: Test and document all implemented functionality

**Comprehensive Testing**:
- All CRUD operations for classes, lectures, flashcards
- Database integration and sample data
- User interface navigation and interactions
- Spaced repetition algorithm functionality

## üíª DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT READY

### Terminal Commands
```bash
# Current working directory
cd /Users/yessir/development/ml_microlearn

# Run app (if not already running)
flutter run -d "iPhone 16 Pro Max"

# Hot reload (press 'r' when app is running)
# Clean build if needed
flutter clean && flutter pub get
```

### IDE Setup
- **Cursor** with Flutter extension
- **Project root**: `/Users/yessir/development/ml_microlearn`
- **Hot reload**: Working automatically on save
- **Simulator**: iPhone 16 Pro Max connected

## üß† CONTEXT FOR NEW SESSION

### What Just Happened
1. **Database conflicts resolved** - removed test code causing crashes
2. **App restored to working state** - clean UI loading properly
3. **Project structure complete** - ready for database testing
4. **Documentation created** - comprehensive status and next steps

### Technical Decisions Made
- **SQLite for local storage** - works offline
- **Provider for state management** - simple and effective  
- **Material Design 3** - modern iOS-native feel
- **Repository pattern** - clean separation of concerns

### User Experience Goals
- **Spaced repetition learning** - smart flashcard scheduling
- **Class-based organization** - lectures within classes
- **Progress tracking** - analytics and mastery levels
- **Push notifications** - study reminders (Phase 2)

---

## üéØ SUCCESS METRICS

### Phase 1.4 Complete When
- Database CRUD operations verified working
- Sample data initializes successfully  
- Spaced repetition algorithm tested
- No crashes during normal usage

### Phase 1.5 Complete When
- Users can create study classes and flashcards
- Quiz interface functional with real data
- Progress tracking displays correctly
- App ready for notification system

---

## üö® POTENTIAL GOTCHAS

### Database Issues
- **Schema migrations** - may need `flutter clean` if changing tables
- **Foreign key constraints** - ensure proper relationships
- **Sample data conflicts** - use unique names/timestamps

### Development Workflow
- **Hot reload** - works for UI, may need restart for database changes
- **Simulator state** - database persists between runs
- **Git commits** - commit frequently with detailed messages

---

## üîÑ TRANSITION COMMAND

**For new terminal session:**

```bash
cd /Users/yessir/development/ml_microlearn
flutter run -d "iPhone 16 Pro Max"
```

**Then start with database validation by creating the debug screen as outlined in NEXT_STEPS.md**

**Ready for seamless continuation! All files and context prepared for immediate productive development.**
